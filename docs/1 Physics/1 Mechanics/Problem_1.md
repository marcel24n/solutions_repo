# Problem 1
It looks like you meant **"projectile motion."** 

Projectile motion is the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air, subject only to the force of gravity and air resistance (if any). The object follows a curved path called a **parabola**.

### Key Features of Projectile Motion:
1. **Two Components of Motion:**
   - **Horizontal Motion**: Constant velocity (no acceleration if air resistance is neglected).
   - **Vertical Motion**: Accelerated motion due to gravity (9.8 m/sÂ² downward on Earth).

2. **Types of Projectile Motion:**
   - **Horizontal Projection**: An object is launched horizontally (e.g., a ball rolling off a table).
   - **Angled Projection**: An object is launched at an angle (e.g., a football kick).

3. **Important Equations:**
   - **Horizontal Distance (Range)**: \( R = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot t \)
   - **Time of Flight**: \( t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g} \)
   - **Maximum Height**: \( H = \frac{(v_0 \sin\theta)^2}{2g} \)
